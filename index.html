<h5>Platform Wars: Fashion in a Digital Future</h5>
<i><h6>Amazon, Farfetch, Walmart, Alibaba and more are all fighting for advantage as the e-commerce landscape shifts.</h6></i>

<div>
	The platform wars have begun- and fashion ins't just in the crossfire, it's the ammunition for the digital giants battling over market share.
</div>
<br>
<div>
Amazon, Walmart Inc., Alibaba, JD.com, eBay, Farfetch and more are all drawing millions of shoppers with massive online offerings.
</div>
<br>
<div>
But for even the biggest players, growth is the key to getting ahead, or keeping ahead. The combatants are global, or moving in that direction, and desperatley need brands- bigger brands, higher-end brands, hotter brands and more.
</div>
<br>
<div>
Some of what the most prominent players offer now is inventory that's owned outright- they operate like an online retailer, buying goods and selling them at a markup. But much of the fashion sold through all of the prominent players, from Amazon through Farfetch, is served up directly by brands or other retailers that use the digital space to court shoppers and pay the platforms for the pleasure.
</div>
<br>
<div>And competition for brands is heating up on all fronts. EBay just sued Amazon, accusing it of inappropriately trying to get eBay sellers to jump ship. Earlier this year and across the Pacific, JD.com, the number-two e-commerce company in China behind Alibaba, said, without naming names, that its competition had tried to take fashion brands" hostage."</div>
<br>
<div>It's a dynamic the industry has seen before.</div>
<br>
<div>A generation ago, brands with enough clout were able to play Macy's off Gimbels, or May Co. off Federated. Vendors gave slightly different looks to both sides, driving sales as the stores competed to draw shoppers to their side of the mall. The department stores tried to get their due when things went bad, collecting" chargeback" or "markdown" money from brands when sales slipped.</div>
<br>
<div>
	It was part and parcel of a well-worn fight where all sides managed to eke out a profit- and come up with plenty to complain about along the way.
</div>
<div>
Now the fight has moved online, where traffic is rushing.
</div>
<br>
<div>
Brands and merchants both naturally follow shoppers. Over the decades, they've moved from Main Street stores to malls to supercenters to outlet centers- the web is the next natural step.
</div>
<br>
<div>
Everyone but the fashion Luddites are online by now, but despite all the glitzy web sites with brand-rich content, the real customer traffic is going to the platforms. Amazon accounts for about half of all online sales in the U.S. and Walmart.com, pedaling hard to catch up online, sees 100 million unique visitors each month.
